It is a hugely diverse area of inner London, reaching from Covent Garden, to Euston and King’s Cross, to Hampstead and Highgate. Camden has 36 designated Conservation Areas, over 5,600 listed buildings and the seventh largest economy in the UK.
    <br /><br />
    Camden Town has been a residential area since the 1790s, but it was the development of the Grand Union Canal and the improved railways that turned it into a bustling part of London. There are 162 English Heritage blue plaques, representing the many diverse personalities that have lived there. "

    "Camden is home to street markets, world-famous music venues, museums, theatres, London Zoo and 681 acres of Hampstead Heath. It is a hugely diverse area of inner London, reaching from Covent Garden, to Euston and King’s Cross, to Hampstead and Highgate. Camden has 36 designated Conservation Areas, over 5,600 listed buildings and the seventh largest economy in the UK.
    <br /><br />
    Camden Town has been a residential area since the 1790s, but it was the development of the Grand Union Canal and the improved railways that turned it into a bustling part of London. There are 162 English Heritage blue plaques, representing the many diverse personalities that have lived there. "
